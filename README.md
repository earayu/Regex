I have implemented regular expression operations for concatenation, alternation, and closure using parentheses and escape symbols: . | * ( ) . The main method is in TEST.java, and the steps are as follows:

1. Handle escape symbols and convert the regular expression into reverse Polish notation.
2. Convert the expression into an NFA.
3. Convert the expression into a DFA.
4. Simulate the DFA operation.

The next step is to implement extended regular expressions.

Testing:

RE: (d(a|b)*c)|adctruedactruedbbbctrueatrue

RE: \.*().*()true

RE: (a|b)(c|e)actruebetrueaetrue
