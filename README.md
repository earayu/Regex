I have implemented regular expression operations for concatenation, alternation, and closure using parentheses and escape symbols: . | * ( ) . The main method is in TEST.java, and the steps are as follows:

1. Handle escape symbols and convert the regular expression into reverse Polish notation.
2. Convert the expression into an NFA.
3. Convert the expression into a DFA.
4. Simulate the DFA operation.

The next step is to implement extended regular expressions.

Testing:

RE :(d(a|b)*c)|a   
dc   
true   

dac   
true

dbbbc   
true

a   
true   

RE :\\\.\*\(\)   
\.*()   
true   

RE :(a|b)(c|e)   
ac   
true   

be   
true   

ae   
true
